text file downloaded from web or generated by program,
for example words database or bin log,
usualy very large, 1m lines or 500k lines ,
you can't open it by a editor,
"file-separ.exe" separate these large files to small text files ,
"./file-separ.exe words04a.txt line 200000"
means separate "words04a.txt" to small text files,
every small text files has 200000 lines,
"./file-separ.exe words04a.txt size 900000"
means separate "words04a.txt" to small text files,
every small text files has 900000 byte,

after separate , you modified these file by editor,
and you want commit to program, you need use "file-merge.exe"
"./file-merge.exe words04a.txt"
means merge words04a.txt.000000.txt words04a.txt.000001.txt ...
to words04a.txt

if a text file is sorted , for example,"words04a.txt",
you can delete some word ,but you can't modify a word,
otherwise, it is not sorted any more.
